This package provides immutable and mutable arrays that can be used in foreign
calls.  They are 16-byte aligned by default to facilitate use of SIMD
instructions.  To build this package, use:

  runhaskell Setup.lhs configure
  runhaskell Setup.lhs build
  runhaskell Setup.lhs haddock          (optional)
  runhaskell Setup.lhs install

Then run the tests:

  cd tests
  ghc -O2 --make tests.hs -o tests && ./tests  # checks QC properties 

In addition, there are versions two of shootout entries which use arrays.
Modified versions of these are in the tests directory, using various array
implementations.  To build, benchmark, and check that results match, run:

  ./runtests.sh
