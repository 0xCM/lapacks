Not done:

The stack of monads consists temporarily of three monads:
   WriterT, custom monad transformer, data-ref monad.

I tried to merge the latter ones to 'm'
which is both an instance of Ref.C and can be extended by the user.
Unfortunately, this means that Sys.globalVariable and Sys.query
are in this monad, which is too much, since they only require (Ref.C m).
I started an attempt in unique-logic-tf-merged-w-s directory.
However, I cannot complete it since Example.Verify.globalVariable
would need to get the variable reference
from a potentially failing Exceptional action.
